# Code of Conduct

Our organisational approach to Inclusion and Diversity has been set out in our [Strategic Business Plan](https://intranet.ons.statistics.gov.uk/ons-strategic-business-plan/), our [Strategic People Plan](https://intranet.ons.statistics.gov.uk/the-strategic-people/) and our [Inclusion and Diversity Strategy](https://intranet.ons.statistics.gov.uk/our-inclusion-and-diversity-strategy/)

At the ONS we believe that our business goals can only be achieved if we promote and sustain an open, inclusive, and supportive working environment. This allows people to make the most of their skills, creativity, and personal qualities to achieve their full potential.

To support this approach we have a comprehensive governance structure in ONS, which drives and monitors our strategic approach to inclusion and diversity, and ensures that we are meeting our legal obligations.
