# Data Protection Guidelines

## Practices

### Data protection by design and by default

The UK Statistics Authority shall ensure that the principles and practices of data protection are built into all processing activities, and that the rights and freedoms of individuals are given due consideration at all times.

Extra protection should be provided, as necessary, to the data of individuals who may be considered vulnerable. Vulnerability can be considered to exist where circumstances may restrict an individual’s ability to freely consent or object to the processing of their personal data, to understand its implications, or where there is an imbalance of power in the relationship between the individual and the Authority.

### Data minimisation

Personal data shall only be processed where it is necessary to achieve the aims of the organisation. Only the minimum amount of personal data required to achieve the aim shall be used. Personal data shall be de-identified or anonymised at the earliest opportunity and in accordance with best practice.

### Data retention

Personal data shall be held only for so long as they continue to enable or assist the UK Statistics Authority undertake its functions. Personal data shall be disposed of appropriately and in accordance with best practice.

### Data security

The UK Statistics Authority shall implement technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the personal data being processed. The measures put in place shall be regularly reviewed.

### Personal data breaches

All breaches that present a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, as determined by the Data Protection Officer, shall be reported to the Information Commissioner at the earliest opportunity and in any event no later than 72 hours from discovery. Where a breach represents a high risk to individuals, the UK Statistics Authority shall notify all data subjects concerned.

### Data protection impact assessments

When introducing a new processing activity that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the UK Statistics Authority business areas will undertake an impact assessment to identify and mitigate those risks and seek guidance from the Data Protection Officer if required.

### Transparency

The UK Statistics Authority will provide data subjects with all the information they require to constitute fair processing, at the point of data collection. Where data are collected from administrative sources this information will be provided to data subjects within one month, unless to do so would be disproportionate effort. In addition, and where possible, such information will also be published on ONS website.

### Records of processing

The UK Statistics Authority shall maintain up to date records of all the processing activities it undertakes.

### Data subject rights

The UK Statistics Authority shall respond to all requests made by data subjects, in relation to the rights they hold under data protection legislation, within one month.

### Consent

Where the UK Statistics Authority relies on consent as a lawful basis for processing that consent shall be fully informed, freely given and as easy to withdraw as to give.

### Processors

The UK Statistics Authority shall only use data processors capable of providing sufficient guarantees in relation to security of personal data and data protection legislation compliance.

### International Data Transfers

Where the UK Statistics Authority transfers personal data internationally, it will only do so where an adequacy regulation is in place, or a safeguard or derogation is used. Where derogations are used, the organisation shall seek the advice of the Data Protection Officer.

### Training

All staff who process personal data will receive adequate and regular training in data protection.

### Data Protection Officer (DPO)

The UK Statistics Authority will nominate a suitably trained and experienced Data Protection Officer to provide advice and guidance on all matters related to data protection. The DPO will report directly to the National Statistician and will have no other duties that may cause a conflict of interest.

### The Information Commissioner

The UK Statistics Authority will provide support and assistance as required by the Information Commissioner in the fulfilment of their tasks.

### Compliance

All staff, contractors and others working on behalf of UK Statistics Authority and its executive office, the ONS, are required to comply with this policy. Compliance with the policy will be monitored by the Data Protection Officer. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action in line with the organisation’s Discipline Policy. Staff making a complaint in relation to the application of this policy should refer to the organisation’s Grievance Policy.
