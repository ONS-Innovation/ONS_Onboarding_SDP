# Setting up Your Workstation

The place of work identified for homeworking must be appropriate and safe. This would normally mean a separate room of sufficient size within the employee’s home.

If a separate room is not available, then the exact area to be used as a workspace should be agreed and documented. Sheds and garages are not generally recommended because of security and safety implications.

Take care when considering attics and cellars (and possible loft conversions) because of problems with temperature, ventilation and provision of natural light. When designating a work area, the following must be considered:

* if there is adequate space for furniture, equipment and storage
* is there a safe means of access and exit?
* can the area be made secure?
* can it be easily be kept clean and uncluttered?
* is there adequate ventilation, lighting and temperature control?
* the possible hazards to others in the household and visitors eg trailing cables as a trip * * hazard to the elderly or access to the computer cable connections for small children

## Safe systems of work
Line managers should consider the way the homeworker intends to complete their work schedule, to see whether any procedures they propose are likely to cause injury or to threaten their health.

## Manual handling issues
Handling loads can cause serious injury, particularly to the back. You should avoid the need for hazardous manual handling when homeworking and discuss with your manager should you need assistance. When lifting is necessary, good techniques can help reduce the risks. Line managers must consider if their staff require manual handling training. There’s more information about this in the manual handling guide.

## Storing, using and transporting articles and substances
Almost all homeworkers will need to store some stationery products. These may include supplies of other substances such as toner. Line managers will need to confirm that such items are being stored safely and correctly. They must also address and help plan how bulk items (eg heavy files) are supplied and transported from the office to the homeworker’s workstation.

## Using substances and materials for work at home
Any equipment, goods and materials supplied by the organisation must be suitable to be used in a home environment and must be handled and stored safely. Toxic products, such as solvents, will be eliminated where possible. All chemicals and goods that may come into close contact with children must be made safe. Homeworkers can check to see if substances and materials are dangerous by looking for hazard warnings on the label of the goods they receive from the organisation. If they feel that an item is unsafe, they shouldn’t attempt to open it and should contact their line manager immediately for advice.

## Adequate information, instruction, training and supervision
Line managers, where required, must organise basic training in the operation of any equipment provided, before the homeworking begins. Homeworkers must receive the same information and training on H&S issues as office-based staff.

## Other home working issues to be addressed

## First Aid
ONS will supply basic first aid materials, and these should be ordered via your business area stationary arrangements.

## Accident reporting
If a Homeworker has an accident and/or sustains an injury during the course of their work, they must report it to the FM Helpdesk and to their Line Manager.  The Line Manager must ensure it is recorded in the Accident Book and should inform the H&S Practitioner.  H&S Practitioners at each site will report and keep a record of certain work-related accidents and incidents.

## Fault reporting
Homeworkers must report all faults associated with their work equipment to the DST Service desk.

## Safe access and egress
A safe means of access to equipment and furniture and a safe means of exit in the event of a fire, must be maintained.  Smoke alarms must be fitted and maintained by the Homeworker.

## Consultation with employees
The Line Manager must ensure the H&S issues raised by homeworkers are presented to the appropriate safety representatives.

## New and expectant mothers
Attention must be paid to homeworkers who are new or expectant mothers.  Risks include those to the unborn child or to the child of a woman who is still breast feeding, not just to risks to the mother herself.  A new or expectant mother means anyone who is pregnant, who has given birth within the previous six months or who is breast feeding.

## Safety and security
To safeguard homeworkers’ privacy, safety and security, meetings with anyone other than work colleagues should be arranged either at the contact’s place of work or at an ONS office and not in the homeworker’s home.
