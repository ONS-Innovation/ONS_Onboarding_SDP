# Mission and Vision

High quality data and analysis to inform the UK, improve lives and build the future.

Official statistics are for the benefit of society and the economy generally. They:

* allow the formulation of better public policy and the effective measurement of those policies
* inform the direction of economic and commercial activities
* provide valuable information for analysts, researchers, public and voluntary bodies
* enable the public to hold to account all organisations that spend public money, thus informing democratic debate
