# Career and Talent Development

The Career & Talent Development team brings together a broad range of learning approaches and support tools – our aim is to enable fulfilling careers for all, through a more inclusive service offering.

The team encompasses five key areas and deliver collaboratively to provide a rounded careers and talent approach:

*Inclusion & Diversity Leadership Development – building targeted development interventions to help drive more positive outcomes for colleagues who encounter barriers, whilst raising cultural awareness and capabilities of managers to lead and support a diverse workforce.
*Professions Career Development – engaging with Heads of Profession (HoP) and HoP Support Managers (HSMs) to offer a professions lens to career pathways, development and talent management.
*Talent Management & Development – offering an inclusive approach to talent development and succession management and driving rich career conversations for all. We apply tools such as the 9 box grid (9BG) to support this activity.
*High Potential Development – nurturing and developing our feeder grades, to support fulfilling career paths and potential progression to more senior leadership roles.
*SCS Performance, Talent & Development – offering an holistic approach to support our SCS senior leadership community in their individual/collective development and progression, and performance and talent management.
