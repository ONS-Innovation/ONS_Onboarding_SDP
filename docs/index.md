### Welcome to ONS Onboarding Documentation
# Welcome to ONS!

You join a team of more than 5,000 colleagues who work flexibly across our sites in Newport, Titchfield, London, Edinburgh, Manchester and Darlington, as well as a large team of interviewers who are based throughout the UK.

We’ve designed this welcome pack to provide you with information you might find helpful before joining the office and in your first few days, but it is a useful reminder for anyone at any stage in their career with us.

## Mission and Vision

High quality data and analysis to inform the UK, improve lives and build the future.

Official statistics are for the benefit of society and the economy generally. They:

* allow the formulation of better public policy and the effective measurement of those policies
* inform the direction of economic and commercial activities
* provide valuable information for analysts, researchers, public and voluntary bodies
* enable the public to hold to account all organisations that spend public money, thus informing democratic debate

## Your first day, at home

### Equipment

We will send your kit by courier. They will deliver your laptop and any other equipment, ready for your first day. 

### Day one 

Once you’re up and running with your equipment, you will receive a welcome email which will explain the induction process and include some helpful training links to get you underway.

### Induction 

We require all new starters to take part in mandatory training, which covers Health and Safety and Security. You can access this training through a variety of platforms. Over your first few weeks you will receive access to a mixture of e-learning and virtual classroom events.

You will be advised that your place on the corporate induction and a follow-up networking event can be booked via the Learning Hub. This will provide you with an overview of the organisation’s values and strategy and we recommend you attend as close to your start date as possible.

Your business area will give you a more detailed introduction so you can learn more about your role and meet your colleagues. They will be there to guide you throughout your career with us in the ONS.
